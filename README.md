We have two TIC TAC TOE python files.

Firstly, In tic-tac-toe.py has a single player and a bot (random ) game . First a player start the game by choosing numbers between 1-9 and then move shifted to bot then again it shifted to player(User).

In tic-tac-toe-bots.py , we can see hoe two bots can play game with random function.
